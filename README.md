## About

Sagittarius is a powerful and free online game service built with [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/). That means you get all the scalability and reliability of Google's products right out of the box. And what's more, Sagittarius is designed to be deployed on your own App Engine account, giving you full control over your game's backend.

## Packages

- [Sagittarius-Py](https://github.com/willyg302/Sagittarius/tree/master/Sagittarius-Py): the working directory of the end-user backend part of Sagittarius, which is replicated over to the official release at every build
- [Sagittarius-StarterKits](https://github.com/willyg302/Sagittarius/tree/master/Sagittarius-StarterKits): source collection of available starter kits for Sagittarius
- [Sagittarius-Wizard](https://github.com/willyg302/Sagittarius/tree/master/Sagittarius-Wizard): source and assets for the Sagittarius Wizard (requires PIL or Pillow to run)
- [Media](https://github.com/willyg302/Sagittarius/tree/master/Media): logos, wallpapers, and other miscellaneous media
